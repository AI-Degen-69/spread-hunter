"""Tradability and horizon gate (U6).

The fleet ran ~74 hours and produced 9 tape-backed fills and zero resolutions.
Neither is a strategy result: the ranker sorts by reward income per dollar of
capital, and that metric prefers a thin book by construction (see the
`rank_markets` docstring -- a $50/day market with a thin book outranks a
$300/day one). Thin books are thin because nobody trades them.

Measured on the 11.6h run of 2026-07-31: 20 markets produced 48 tape prints
between them and 9 of the 20 traded not once. Every market in the universe
resolved between September 2026 and 2027, so no run of any practical length
could observe a settlement.

Two filters the ranker never had:

  * VOLUME. A market that does not trade cannot fill a resting order, whatever
    its reward yield. Reward income is real, but it is a different strategy and
    must not be measured with fill-based instruments.
  * HORIZON. A market resolving in 2027 cannot contribute a settled P&L
    observation to a run measured in days.
