"""The allocator must be able to fund a market it defunded (U6).

Measured on run/fleet.db, a 13.4h forward run: reward samples with a non-zero
`our_score` decayed monotonically -- 67/219 in the first ten minutes, 9/190 by
hour seven, then 0/190 for the last 5.5 hours straight. The last quote of the
run went out at T+8.1h. Nothing had crashed and the books were still being
sampled; the fleet had simply defunded every market and had no way back.

The latch was two gates keyed on measurements that only exist WHILE quoting:

  * `_live["income"]` is `share * daily`, and `share` is our score in a book we
    are no longer resting in -- zero by construction once defunded.
  * `_live["capital"]` sums our open orders -- also zero by construction.

So the first gate defunds a market for earning nothing, and the second
(`if not share or not capital: continue`) then drops that same market out of
the observation set entirely, where it can never be reconsidered. One-way.

The competition's depth is the input that survives: `market_score` is scored
over the whole book and is measured whether or not we participate. Every
market in the stalled run still had a live `theirs` reading (1,504 on Taylor
Swift at the moment the fleet was quoting nothing at all). Sizing off that,
rather than off our own absent orders, is what makes the decision reversible.
