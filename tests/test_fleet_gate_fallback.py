"""The gate was unreachable, and lowering the threshold alone does not fix it.

`markout_min_sample` was 20. Measured on run/fleet.db over the 2026-08-02 run:
47 markout rows across 19 markets, and the BEST sampled market matured 7. So
`per_market_stats` returned `insufficient_sample` for every market on every
cycle, `next_state` returns the state unchanged on that verdict, and
`gate_state` stayed NORMAL for the whole run -- `market_gate` finished with
zero rows. No market was ever widened and none was ever exited.

Dropping the threshold to 8 still leaves 0/19 qualifying. Markets here rotate
daily and individually never accumulate a sample; what actually makes the gate
reachable is the POOLED verdict, which reaches n=43 on the same data.

The cap on that fallback is the other half. EXITED is terminal, and the pooled
mean is -4.75c/share -- past the catastrophic threshold -- so an uncapped
fallback would permanently blacklist all 19 markets at once, including the
three that were individually earning (+4.4c, +5.0c, +5.3c).
