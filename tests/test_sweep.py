"""The sweep module's settle-and-cancel step (issue #11).

The per-market sweep in `strategy.fleet.visit` used to own settle/cancel
inline; the step now lives behind `strategy.sweep`'s interface so it can be
driven directly: feed a market state and a now, assert the outcome. The
startup-settle pass itself is covered in `test_fleet_startup_settle` through
the same interface; these tests cover the parts the startup pass does not
exercise: the mid-life settle (`_settle_resolved`), the bare cancel
(`_cancel_live_orders`) and the event dedup (`_record_event`).
