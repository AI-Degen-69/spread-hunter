"""Restart amnesia: an EXITED verdict must survive the process that made it.

EXITED is the only gate state that is expensive to rediscover. It is the
conclusion of `markout_min_sample` fills proving a market takes money off us,
and the fleet used to throw it away on every restart -- re-entering the market
and buying that same evidence again. A process restart is not new information
about the market.
