"""The per-market cost cap has to bind on the ORDER, not on the inventory.

`max_cost_per_market` was enforced in one place, quotes.py:

    if inv.cost >= cfg.max_cost_per_market and mine >= theirs:

Both halves of that condition are post-hoc. `inv.cost` is what we ALREADY
hold, so a market holding nothing passes at any order size, and `mine >=
theirs` restricts the check to the heavy leg. Measured on run/fleet.db over
the 2026-08-02 run:

    dota2-rnx-yb1-2026-08-02-game2  UP  900sh @ 0.880 = $792.00  crossed=0

One resting order, one fill, $792 -- 79% of a $1,000 wallet and 1.98x a $400
cap, on a market whose inventory was $0.00 when the order went out. The cap
never had anything to bind against.

These tests pin the arithmetic that closes it: the size is chosen against
`max_cost_per_market - inv.cost` at the moment it is posted.
