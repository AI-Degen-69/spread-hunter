"""Store-level coverage for `strategy.store.verified_ratio()`.

`verified_ratio()` is the Phase A decision-gate number: the share-weighted
fraction of fills the trade tape actually confirmed. The ratio lives on the
edge of three categories whose semantics differ:

  - `reason='tape'`           in `fills`            -> verified
  - `reason IN ('queue','sweep')` in `fills`        -> legacy (pre-U1)
  - `reason LIKE 'unverified_%'`  in `unverified_fills` -> unverified

The engine-level read in `tests/test_fills.py` covers the happy path, but
what reads on a real DB are the boundary cases: empty (nothing observed),
legacy-only (delta-credited fills predate the tape gate), and mixed (real
verification happening alongside speculation). The number consumers decide
on is `ratio`, and the cases that distinguish it are at `verified_*.shares == 0`,
`unverified_*.shares == 0`, and both > 0.
