"""The water-fill was read as a diversifier and is not one.

`marginal` is daily*T/(capital+T)^2. Whenever competitor depth T dominates our
own size that expression is nearly FLAT in capital -- so the argmax never
changes hands, one market wins every increment, and the loop is a
winner-take-all auction wearing a diminishing-returns costume.

Measured 2026-08-02: one market took the entire $900 budget, `shares_for`
turned it into a 900-share order, and it filled in a single print for $792 --
79% of a $1,000 wallet, against a nominal $400 per-market cost cap.

`max_market_frac` bounds any one market's share of the budget. 0.15 puts the
floor at roughly seven concurrently funded markets, and that number comes from
the variance rather than from taste: per-fill markout measured -$7.58 with a
standard deviation of $56.68, so at full concentration one fill moves the book
by more than the entire expected edge of a hundred fills.
