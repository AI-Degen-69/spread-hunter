"""The Maker Rebates Program pays on MATCHED volume, never on waiting.

Written after a plan proposed reporting rebates as `score_share x pot x
uptime` -- the resting-size formula. That is the LIQUIDITY REWARDS program,
which is a different product and reads $0 here because every market the fleet
currently holds publishes clobRewards: 0. Conflating the two would have
labelled a spread-capture projection as a venue rebate and added it to the
headline a second time, on top of the booked P&L those same fills already
produced.

The rebate is a share of the taker fee paid on volume we made:

    rebate = rebate_rate * (shares * fee_rate * p * (1 - p))

so an unfilled resting order earns exactly zero no matter how long it rests,
and a crossed fill earns zero because we were the taker on it -- crediting our
own aggressive leg with a MAKER rebate would pay us for the side we are also
being charged a fee on.
