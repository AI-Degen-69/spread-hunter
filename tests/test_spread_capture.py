"""Sizing a market that pays no rewards at all (U6).

Six runs produced 9 tape-backed fills in 74 hours and zero settled
resolutions. The universe was the cause: the ranker funds only markets with
`rewards.rates != null`, the allocator values a market at `daily x share`, and
a market with `clobRewards: 0` therefore scores exactly zero however much it
trades. bitcoin-up-or-down-* turns ~$92k in 24 hours and resolves the same day
-- it is precisely the market a fill-based measurement needs, and it was
unfundable by construction.

Spread capture gives that market a pot in the same units, so it competes in the
same water-fill. The $1.50/day payout floor does NOT follow it across: that is
the venue's minimum reward DISTRIBUTION, and nothing is distributed on a market
that pays no rewards.
