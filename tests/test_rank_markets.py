"""Market selection tests (U4).

Two failures the 18.7h run exposed, both in how markets get chosen rather
than how they get quoted:

  * A market projecting under Polymarket's $1 minimum payout earns exactly
    zero, not a small amount. 16 of 20 fleet markets were in that state,
    holding capital and paying nothing.
  * Competing depth was read once. That single snapshot reported a competing
    score of 35 for a market that measured 3,727 live, and the top-ranked
    market went on to deliver $0.25/day against $18.96 projected.
