"""Sweep duration must be MEASURED by the fleet, not inferred by the page.

The dashboard reported "Fleet is live, but a full sweep is taking 30m41s"
against a fleet whose log showed a completed sweep every 21 seconds. The figure
came from `now - max(_live.ts)`: the age of the freshest per-market payload.
That is not a sweep duration. `visit` returns early -- before the `_live` write
-- for a market it cannot load, and 10 of 20 markets had settled overnight, so
the number was really "how long since the last market that still worked
answered", and it grew without bound.

The tests below pin the separation:

  * the fleet publishes the duration it actually measured,
  * a sweep in progress is visible before it completes,
  * unreadable markets no longer inflate the sweep figure,
  * a market that fails records WHY, without back-dating its figures.
