"""Pre-register a live-test prediction, then reconcile it against reality.

The one thing the simulator has never verified is that rent actually arrives.
Every income figure on the dashboard is our own arithmetic on published rates
multiplied by a share we computed ourselves. No payout has ever landed.

This turns one small real order into an experiment rather than an anecdote.
The prediction is written to disk BEFORE the payout, together with the book
state it was derived from, so it cannot be quietly adjusted afterwards to match
whatever happened. That is the entire point: a forecast you can edit after the
result is not evidence.

    python -m scripts.live_test predict <slug> --price 0.50 --size 20
    python -m scripts.live_test reconcile <slug> --received 0.83 --hours 18

It places no orders and holds no keys. Placing the order is a human step, done
on Polymarket's own interface.
