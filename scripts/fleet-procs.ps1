# Ownership of fleet processes, shared by fleet-start.ps1 and fleet-stop.ps1.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Both scripts used to select processes with command-line
# wildcards -- "*strategy.fleet*" and friends -- and then Stop-Process -Force
# whatever matched. That pattern matches the same module name in ANY checkout
# and ANY session on the machine: a second clone, another user's fleet, a
# colleague's debugging run. Killing one takes its database writer with it, and
# nothing in the match says which fleet it belonged to.
#
# So ownership is RECORDED at launch instead of inferred at shutdown. The
# launcher writes the PIDs it actually started to run/fleet.pids.json, and
# shutdown stops those process trees and nothing else.
#
# PID reuse is the obvious hole in that plan -- Windows recycles PIDs freely,
# and a stale file naming PID 4820 must not kill whatever holds 4820 today. So
# each record carries the process start time, and a PID is only accepted when
# BOTH the id and its start time still match. A recycled PID has a different
# start time and is left alone.

$FleetPidFile = Join-Path $ProjectPath "run/fleet.pids.json"

# Reporting only -- never a kill list. Kept so an operator can be TOLD about a
# fleet this script does not own, rather than silently killing it.
