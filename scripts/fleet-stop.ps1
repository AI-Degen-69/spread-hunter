# Stop the fleet this checkout started.
#
# Hidden processes cannot be closed by shutting a window, which is the point of
# running them hidden and also the reason this script has to exist. The old
# foreground launcher stopped a previous fleet only on its way to starting a
# new one; the current `fleet-start.ps1` does the same (it stops the recorded
# instance before launching), but stopping without restarting is this script's
# whole job.
#
#   .\scripts\fleet-stop.ps1            stop the recorded fleet
#   .\scripts\fleet-stop.ps1 -Strays    also stop fleet-shaped processes this
#                                       checkout did not start (see below)
#
# The database is left exactly where it is. Stopping is not archiving.
#
# WHY -Strays IS OPT-IN. This script used to select processes by command-line
# wildcard -- "*strategy.fleet*" and friends -- and force-kill everything that
# matched. That matches the same module name in ANY checkout and ANY session on
# the machine, so running it could take down a colleague's fleet, or a second
# clone of your own, along with its database writer. Ownership is now recorded
# at launch in run/fleet.pids.json and shutdown is scoped to it.
#
# A fleet started before that file existed, or started by hand, is not recorded
# and will NOT be stopped by default -- it is reported instead. -Strays is how
# you say "yes, those are mine too", which is a decision this script is not
# entitled to make on your behalf.
