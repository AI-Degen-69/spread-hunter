# There used to be two launchers: a FOREGROUND variant of this same name
# (supervisor tied to a PowerShell window, one visible terminal per process),

# One is enough, and background is the mode that survives closing the window
# that launched it. This script is that one -- the name `fleet-start.ps1`
# now means "start in the background".
#
# Duplicates are stopped BEFORE starting: it stops the fleet THIS checkout
# recorded in run/fleet.pids.json (children included, so no second writer can
# corrupt the database), reports -- but does not kill -- fleet-shaped
# processes that belong to another checkout, and refuses to start if an
# unrelated process owns port 8800. Every stream is redirected to a file, so
# closing the window that launched it changes nothing.
