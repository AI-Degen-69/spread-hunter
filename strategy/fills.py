"""Queue-aware fill simulation for resting maker bids, driven by BOOK DELTAS.

WHY THIS IS THE WHOLE PROJECT
-----------------------------
A maker's edge is buying at the bid instead of crossing to the mid. Measured
from powerwinner's 56,768 fills, spread capture is ~68% of his gross; the
"buy both sides" pair clears only 0.10% and is favourable just 51% of the time,
so the arbitrage story is NOT the business. The business is: rest, don't cross.

That makes one question decisive -- do we actually get filled? A naive model
("the ask touched my price, so I filled") answers yes every time and therefore
invents 100% of the edge. This module refuses to do that.

WHY BOOK DELTAS AND NOT THE TRADE TAPE
--------------------------------------
First attempt keyed fills off the trade tape's `side` field: a taker SELL lifts
a bid. Measured on the live tape, 194 of 200 rows were "BUY". The reason is that
data-api /trades reports each PARTICIPANT's own side, not the aggressor's -- a
maker whose bid gets lifted appears as a "BUY" too (it's powerwinner's own fills
in that feed). So aggressor direction is not recoverable from it, and a
SELL-only rule would report almost no fills and wrongly kill the strategy.

Book deltas avoid the problem entirely. We poll the book; the size resting at
our price level is directly observable, and its decrease is exactly the queue
moving. Verified live: levels move materially every few seconds (60 -> 0 in 6s).

THE MODEL
---------
Posting a bid at price P puts us at the BACK of the queue at that level:
    queue_ahead = size currently resting at P

Each book poll:
  * size at P DECREASED by X  -> the queue ahead of us shrank by X. Once
    queue_ahead reaches 0, any further decrease is us being filled.
  * P is gone from the book / best bid fell below P -> the level was cleared
    outright, so our remainder filled.
  * size at P INCREASED -> people joined BEHIND us. Irrelevant to our fills;
    queue_ahead never grows.

STATED BIASES (each makes us OPTIMISTIC -- treat output as an upper bound)
  1. A decrease may be a CANCEL rather than a fill. Cancels do move us up the
     queue (correct), but we also credit the post-queue remainder as our fill,
     which over-fills us when the level is being cancelled rather than traded.
  2. We assume strict price-time priority and that we joined at the exact
     moment of the snapshot.
  3. Adverse selection is NOT softened anywhere: we get filled precisely when
     someone wants to sell to us, which is disproportionately when the market
     is about to move against us. That cost shows up in the resolution outcome,
     which is the honest place for it.

        THE AMENDMENT PENALTY (Phase 1, component 1). A repriced order is a new
        order at the back of the new level's queue. No venue carries seniority
        across a price change, and modelling one that did is the cheapest way
        to manufacture fills: an order could chase the touch all day and keep
        arriving at the front, which is exactly the free edge the tape-only
        rule was built to withdraw.

        This is a RULE, not a fitted parameter. There is nothing here to tune
        against the fill-rate residual, which is why it is the one haircut
        component that can be asserted outright rather than estimated.

        The engine has no in-place reprice today -- the sweep cancels and
        reposts, and `post()` already reads the new level's depth -- so this
        method changes no current behaviour. It exists so the invariant has a
        single enforced home: a caller that reprices through here cannot
        inherit seniority, and one that sets `order.price` directly is now
        visibly bypassing the rule rather than quietly satisfying it.

        Already-filled shares survive the amendment -- they are done, and the
        remainder is what gets requeued. A same-price call is not an amendment
        and is left alone; resetting on it would penalise the sweep's

        model that fills 0 of 150 shares even as the book trades straight
