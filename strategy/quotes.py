      * It scores. The reward is paid on resting size sampled once a minute,
        whether or not the order is ever hit, so time in the book is the
        product. The old objective's gates left us out of the book 69% of the
        time, which is 69% of the pool forfeited.
      * The pair is cheap by construction. mid_up + mid_down ~ 1.00, so bidding
        `offset` under mid on each side makes the pair cost ~1.00 - 2*offset.
        Quoting off the ASK did the opposite: ~half a spread ABOVE mid on each
        side, i.e. 1.00 + spread, which is why no sub-$1.00 pair ever appeared.

    Still deliberately NOT gated on the QUOTING WINDOW. That rule exists to
    protect fill quality by refusing to open late, and here a fill is a side
    effect: the score is paid on resting size every minute the order is there,
    so a cycle spent sitting out earns nothing and buys nothing.

    The PRICE BAND and the PAIR-COST cap used to be excused on the same
    reasoning, and that reasoning was wrong -- not because sitting out is
    cheap, but because neither rule protects fill quality alone. Outside the
    band the spread has collapsed on an outcome the market already considers
    settled, so the rent is small AND the naked leg a fill creates is decided
    against us. A pair over $1.00 is not a worse fill, it is a booked loss on
    an instrument that pays exactly $1.00. Both now run in `risk.hard_block`,
    on this path. They were unreachable rather than declined: both sit in the
    legacy branch of `decide_quotes`, below the line where this function
    returns, and the telemetry reads as absent rules would -- fills averaged
    0.8152 against a nominal 0.30-0.70 band, and wta-kalinsk-kessler bought 14
