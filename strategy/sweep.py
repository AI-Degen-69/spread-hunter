"""The market sweep -- one pass of the fleet engine over one market.

Second slice of the sweep extraction (issue #12) completes the module: the
book gate, quote decision, size caps and event recording now live behind the
sweep's ONE interface -- `sweep(state, ctx) -> outcome` -- and the fleet loop
in `strategy.fleet` keeps orchestration only (pulse, reallocation,
scheduling, settlement). The settle-and-cancel step moved here first (issue
#11); the rest of the former `fleet.visit` body followed behind the private
seams below.

The vocabulary is defined in `CONTEXT.md`: the sweep is the per-market unit
of engine work; the book gate is its first decision; the settle-and-cancel
step is the first internal seam. Everything under `sweep()` is a private
step: identity gate, market load, book gate, fill processing, gate advance,
exits, requote, score-and-publish. Feed a state and a context (books come
from the context's fetchers), assert the outcome -- that is the interface
the tests drive.

Exceptions propagate to the caller: the fleet loop owns catching them and
keeping the heartbeat alive, exactly as it did around `visit`.
