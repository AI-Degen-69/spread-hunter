"""Turn a locked pair back into working capital.

A matched pair pays exactly $1.00 -- in 2027. Until then the money that
bought it is immobilised, and immobilised money earns no daily rent. That is
the real cost of a fill, and nothing in the strategy addressed it: every
position simply rode to settlement.

If the pair can be sold today for more than it cost, the trade is finished
early -- the profit is booked and the capital goes back to work. Selling
means crossing the spread on BOTH legs, so the move has to be big enough to
cover two taker fees before it is worth anything at all.

Pure arithmetic. It decides; the caller applies.

    `up_bids` / `dn_bids` are the venue's full bid LADDERS for each side --
    `{price: size}`, the same shape `full_book()` in strategy/markets.py returns
    as `book["bids"]`. We would be the seller, and a seller hits bids, never
    asks.

    Only `min(up_shares, down_shares)` is considered. The naked residue is
    left entirely alone: it is a directional bet, owned by skew and the
    exposure caps, and closing it here would be a different decision wearing
    this one's clothes.

    DEPTH, not top-of-book. On the thin books this strategy targets, the
    resting bid is often a fraction of the paired position -- "closing" 600
    pairs against a 50-share bid is fiction. The sellable quantity is capped
    at the smaller of the two legs' available depth (a pair needs one UP
    share sold AND one DOWN share sold), and never exceeds `paired`.

    We WALK the ladder rather than pricing everything at the top: it is the
    honest number, since selling size below the top level really does average
    down to a worse price, and pricing a large close at the top tick would
    book proceeds nobody could actually collect. Because deeper levels are
    worse, the achieved average price falls as the size sold grows, so the
    profitability test below is run on the ACHIEVED average price for the
    size actually being closed, not on the top-of-book price.

    A partial close -- sell what the book can absorb, leave the rest -- is
    the intended behaviour, not a degraded case. `shares` in the returned
    dict is the quantity actually closable, and `cost_basis` / `proceeds` /
    `fee` / `realized_pnl` are all computed on that quantity so the caller's
    arithmetic (which mutates inventory by exactly `shares`) stays consistent.

    `capital_scarce` is the allocator's report that the budget is the binding
    constraint on a market still returning well above the marginal floor (see
    `allocate.capital_scarcity`). When it is set, the required net drops from
    `profit_take_net_threshold` to `scarcity_close_threshold` -- a slightly
    NEGATIVE number, so a stagnant pair is sold at a small loss to free the
    dollars behind it.

    That is not a contradiction of the threshold above, it is the threshold
    finally pricing the alternative. The normal rule compares closing against
    holding and nothing else; under scarcity the true comparison is closing
    against the return the freed capital earns in the starved market, which is
    measured in per-DAY percent while the concession here is a one-off half a
    cent per share.

    Deliberately bounded: the relaxed threshold is a fraction of a fee, not an
    instruction to dump inventory. A pair far under water still fails it.

    Never mutates `inv`.
