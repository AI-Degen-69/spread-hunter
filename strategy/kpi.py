"""Maker KPIs.

A taker asks "was I right?". A maker asks "did I get filled, at what price
relative to fair, and did I get picked off?". These are the metrics that tell
you whether to keep going, and they have no equivalent in the taker dashboard.

The headline decomposition splits P&L into the two things that actually pay:
  SPREAD CAPTURE   shares x (mid_at_post - fill_price)  -- the maker's edge
  DIRECTIONAL      what the resolution did to us        -- the maker's cost
  REBATE (est.)    volume-based estimate, never blended into realized PnL

    #   1. btc-updown-5m has rewards.rates = null on /clob/markets. The
    #      liquidity-rewards program -- the one that pays for RESTING size --
    #      is not funded on this market. min_size/max_spread are set, but with
    #      no rate attached they fund nothing.
    #   2. What this market does have is the Maker Rebates Program, and that
    #      pays on MATCHED volume only: "you earn based on the share of
    #      liquidity you provided that actually got taken",
    #          rebate = 0.20 * (shares * 0.07 * p * (1-p))
