"""LIVE order execution against Polymarket CLOB. Real money.

Everything else in this repo is a simulator. This file is the one place that
can lose actual funds, so it is deliberately small, deliberately manual, and
refuses to do anything by default.

CREDENTIALS NEVER APPEAR HERE. They are read from the environment and handed
straight to the client. Nothing in this module prints, logs, or writes a key,
and nothing that does should ever be added to it.

    # in .env, which must be in .gitignore BEFORE the key goes in
    POLY_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...      # signing key
    POLY_FUNDER=0x...           # address actually holding the USDC
    POLY_SIG_TYPE=1             # 0 EOA | 1 email-magic proxy | 2 browser proxy

    python -m strategy.live_exec status
    python -m strategy.live_exec quote <condition_id> --price 0.22 --size 20
    python -m strategy.live_exec quote <condition_id> --price 0.22 --size 20 --live
    python -m strategy.live_exec cancel-all --live

SAFETY RAILS, all on by default:
  * --live is required for anything that reaches the venue. Without it every
    command prints what it WOULD send and exits.
  * MAX_ORDER_USD caps one order; MAX_TOTAL_USD caps everything open at once.
  * Each leg is written to run/live_orders.json as it is sent, so a crash
    mid-flight still leaves a record of what went out.
  * cancel-all is its own command, because the thing you want at 3am is a way
    to pull every quote without reading code first.
  * Nothing here is imported by fleet.py. The automated bot cannot reach this
    module, so it cannot place a real order by accident.

SIGNATURE TYPE IS THE USUAL FOOTGUN. An account funded through the Polymarket
website is a PROXY: signature_type 1 or 2, with POLY_FUNDER set to the proxy
address rather than the address the private key derives to. Get it wrong and
orders are rejected -- or signed against an account with no balance. Run
`status` first and confirm the address it prints is the one holding your money.
