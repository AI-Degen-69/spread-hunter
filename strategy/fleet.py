"""One process, many markets.

Breadth beats depth here. Income is `rate * ours/(ours+theirs)` per market, so
piling capital into one book fights yourself over a fixed pot -- measured,
$3,000 into a single market returns ~1.0%/day while the same money spread over
20 markets returns ~5%/day, because each market is a separate pot with its own
competition.

Why one process rather than 20 copies of strategy.main: 20 markets x 2 books
polled every second is 40 requests/second against a public API. That gets
rate-limited, and the failure mode is silent -- the bots keep reporting uptime
while scoring nothing. Here markets are visited on a rotation with a fixed
request budget, so adding markets lengthens the sweep instead of raising the
request rate.

        and a pooled reading is not evidence about THIS market -- the pooled
        mean on that run is -4.75c/share, past the catastrophic threshold, so

        bad universe is right; sentencing an unmeasured market on someone
        else's evidence is not.

    A market already EXITED stays EXITED: the cap must never become a route
