# Task 5 (Task C): Supervisor Implementation Report

## Summary

Successfully created and tested the supervisor module that owns both processes (fleet and dashboard) and restarts either when it exits. The implementation follows the exact specification from the brief and all tests pass.

## Files Created

1. **`strategy/supervisor.py`** - Main supervisor module (127 lines)
   - Imports: logging, os, subprocess, sys, time, pathlib
   - Constants: ROOT, STABLE_SEC=60.0, POLL_SEC=2.0, CHILDREN dict
   - Public interface:
     - `next_restart_delay(consecutive_crashes: int) -> float` - Exponential backoff capped at 60s
     - `main() -> None` - Supervisor entry point
   - Private classes:
     - `Child` - Manages individual process lifecycle (start, check, stop)

2. **`tests/test_supervisor.py`** - Test suite (24 lines)
   - Added sys.path manipulation (standard pattern used by other tests in project)
   - Four tests covering:
     - First crash restarts at 5s
     - Repeat crashes back off exponentially
     - Backoff is capped at 60s
     - Recovered child starts from bottom again (crash count reset)

## Implementation Notes

### One Ambiguity Resolved
- **Import path setup**: Existing test files in the project use `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent))` to enable strategy package imports. This pattern was followed in `test_supervisor.py` to match project conventions and allow pytest to find the strategy module.

### Design Verification
- `next_restart_delay()` correctly implements exponential backoff:
  - crashes=0: 5.0s (recovered/first run)
  - crashes=1: 5.0s (first crash)
  - crashes=2: 10.0s
  - crashes=3: 20.0s
  - crashes=99: 60.0s (capped)
  
- `Child` class:
  - Tracks process state (alive/dead), crash count, start time, restart time
  - Clears crash count after child survives `STABLE_SEC` (60s)
  - Logs all state transitions at INFO/ERROR levels to `logs/supervisor.log`
  
- `main()` function:
  - Requires `HUNTER_DB` environment variable (exits with clear message if missing)
  - Spawns both fleet and dashboard children
  - Polls every `POLL_SEC` (2s) to check child status and schedule restarts
  - Gracefully terminates children on keyboard interrupt (signal handling)

### Code Quality
- Exactly matches brief specification (lines 455-589 from plan)
- No imports from strategy package (by design, only spawns processes)
- Uses standard Python subprocess module for process management
- Proper logging setup with file and console handlers
- Type hints throughout (PEP 484 compliant)

## Verification Checklist

- [x] `strategy/supervisor.py` created with exact code from brief
- [x] `tests/test_supervisor.py` created with four tests from brief
- [x] `python -m pytest tests/test_supervisor.py -v` shows 4 passed
- [x] No other files modified
- [x] No imports from strategy package (supervisor is self-contained)
- [x] Code follows project conventions (import paths, logging, etc.)

## Concerns

None. The implementation is complete and all tests pass. The module is ready for integration with the full supervisor workflow (managing both fleet.py and fleet_dash.py processes).

## Next Steps (Not This Task)

Task 6 (DEMO run) will:
1. Set HUNTER_DB environment variable
2. Execute `python -m strategy.supervisor`
3. Verify both child processes start and are monitored correctly
4. Confirm crash detection and restart logic works in practice
